# Java Swing Todo App

A simple Todo app made with Java and Swing, using the MVVM pattern.

## Requirements

I made this using Java 17, however I'm actually clueless about the Java world, so I don't know it could work with other Java versions (read below for details).

## Background

I started this yesterday (nov 29, 2024, around 8 PM) as an experiment, all because I was talking with a friend who's learning Java at the university, and he sent me some Java code as a joke, in that code he was using Swing to create some UIs, and I was a bit curious about that, so I decided (somehow as a personal challenge) try to make a small app in Java with Swing.

And so, after some research on the internet, I was somehow able to create this, which is, IMO, quite impressive to be my first time doing stuff with Java. Ngl, I had some fun making this and learned some new stuff which is always a nice thing.
